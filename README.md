   ```
2. Compose the containers
    ```bash

    ```

#### Creating the environment

1. Create a new `.env` file at the root of the project
2. Refer to the `example.env` file, replacing values where required

#### Migration and Seeding

1. Run all of the migrations by executing

   ```
2. Seed the database with
